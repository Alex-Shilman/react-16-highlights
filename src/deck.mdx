# What is Fiber?

<Appear>
  <h2>A new rendering engine -- that's all.</h2>
  <h2>But there are some consequences.</h2>
  <div style={{ display: 'block', background:'#cccccc', width: '80%', padding: '10p'}}>
    When replacing &lt;A /&gt; with &lt;B /&gt;, B.componentWillMount now always happens before A.componentWillUnmount. Previously, A.componentWillUnmount could fire first in some cases.
  </div>
</Appear>

```notes
Fiber isn't a "feature" you would be using directly, it's plumbing.
It was a necessary step to _enable_ other features like lazy/Suspense and concurrent rendering.
